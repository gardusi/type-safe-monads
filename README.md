# `type-safe-monads`

Adds type guard to Monapt and guarantees that empty values won't be unwrapped incorrectly, causing runtime failures. Such type guard transform the issues into a transpile time failure.

This implementation is powered by [Monapt](https://github.com/jiaweihli/monapt). Take some time to show some appreciation to the original author.
